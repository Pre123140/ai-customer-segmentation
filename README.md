# AI-Powered Customer Segmentation (Basic Version)

A beginner-friendly machine learning project that applies **K-Means Clustering** to segment mall customers based on their income and spending patterns. Ideal for marketers, analysts, and students learning unsupervised learning, this project builds a complete pipeline from preprocessing to visualization and delivers cluster insights in an actionable format.

---

## Project Objective

* Cluster customers using K-Means to identify hidden patterns
* Explore how annual income and spending score relate to customer behavior
* Analyze and interpret the segments formed for marketing or business strategy
* Export clear and interpretable outputs to drive persona-based insights

---

## Key Features

* **Elbow Method** â€“ Determine optimal number of clusters (K) based on WCSS
* **StandardScaler** â€“ Normalize income and spending data
* **KMeans Clustering** â€“ Segment customers using income and spending score
* **Cluster Labeling** â€“ Assign cluster numbers and interpret behavior
* **Data Export** â€“ Save results as .csv and .xlsx for reuse
* **Visual Table Output** â€“ Tabular summaries embedded into analysis

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pre123140/Customer_Segmentation
cd Customer_Segmentation
```

### 2. Set Up the Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
```

### 3. Install the Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Execute the Script

```bash
python customer_segmentation.py
```

All processed cluster insights will be saved in:

* `cluster_summary.csv`
* `cluster_counts.csv`
* `Customer_Segmentation_Results.xlsx`
